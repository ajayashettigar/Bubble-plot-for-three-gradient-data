# HPV Bubble Plot Visualization

This script generates a **bubble plot** to visualize **HPV measurement values** across multiple time points for different **sample IDs**. It utilizes **bubble sizes and colors** to represent data values while distinguishing small values using triangles.

## Features
✅ **Time Point Order Preserved**: Ensures the exact column order from the Excel file.  
✅ **Bubble Size & Color Mapping**: Uses square-root scaling for better visibility.  
✅ **Jittering (Optional)**: Prevents overlapping points for clarity.  
✅ **Colormap**: Uses a reversed 'plasma' colormap for high contrast.  
✅ **Custom Axis Labels**: Provides clear x-axis and y-axis labels.  
✅ **High-Resolution Output**: Saves the plot as **SVG (vector)** and **JPG (600 DPI)**.

```

3️⃣ Run the Script
Execute the Python script:
```
python bubble_plot.py
```

4️⃣ Check Output Files
The generated figures will be saved as:

bubble_plot.svg (Scalable Vector Format)
bubble_plot.jpg (High-Resolution 600 DPI)
